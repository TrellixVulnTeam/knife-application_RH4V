### Knife Application

### Preview
<a href="https://ibb.co/NY1TS87"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/7ygk4wb/knife-template.png" alt="knife-template" border="0"></a>  
It's a landing page creation platform with single page. I practiced HTML and CSS, SASS structure, BEM methodology, little bit of Bootstrap grid system, hover animations and pixel perfect design. Project is only available on desktop size but its still on development for small screens.
